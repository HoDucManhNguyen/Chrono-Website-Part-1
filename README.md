# Chrono-Website-Part-1
This group assignment will familiarise you with the techniques and skills involved in designing and creating static webpages utilising validated HTML and CSS created with a standard text editor. You will deploy these Web pages on a Unix / Apache server. This should be done in a way that keeps HTML content and CSS presentation separate.
